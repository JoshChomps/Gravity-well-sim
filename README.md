# 3D Gravity Simulator

A physics simulation visualizing gravitational forces and spacetime curvature.

## How to Run (Choose Option A or B)

You do **NOT** need to do both. Just pick the one that is easiest for you.

### Option A: VS Code (Recommended)
1.  Open this folder in VS Code.
2.  Look at the bottom-right corner for the Python version.
3.  Click it and select the **`.venv`** environment (Python 3.12.x).
4.  Open `main.py` and press the **Run** button (play icon).

*This sets VS Code to always use the correct isolated environment, avoiding conflicts with Miniconda.*

### Option B: Double-Click Script
1.  Navigate to this folder in File Explorer.
2.  Double-click **`run.bat`**.

*This script automatically finds and uses the correct environment for you.*
